'''
This module contains helper methods for dealing with the contents of the typing module. This
module is not really stable so there are differences even between minor versions. See:

    https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/typing.html

Note that this module is flaky and very hacky, but hopefully later we can use some external
tool for this.

# There is no good, idiomatic way to determine if an annotation is a union or not,
# so we're saddled with this hacky solution.
